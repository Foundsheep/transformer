## Transformer implementation in Tensorflow

- project number : impl_001
- purpose : I started this project because of an unanswered question inside of me, which is 'what the heck are those Q, K, V in transformer', and by implementing it, I wanted to get a grasp of what they are and how they work mathmatically

### Model architecture

- will be added

### Dataset
